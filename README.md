# AI Scratch Remix

### Instructions
1. Read this [AI page on the Scratch wiki](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence).
1. Explore the example projects at the bottom of the page.
1. Pick one of those example projects to remix, then change it in at least one substantial way to make it unique. (been too long since you've used Scratch? take some time to look for resources and re-familiarize yourself!)
1. Go to [edublogs here](https://wcssketchbook.edublogs.org/wp-admin/post-new.php) and write a new blog post with the following sections:
   - summary of the AI in Scratch wiki page
   - which project you picked to remix and why, with a link to the *original* unmixed project
   - what you changed about that project, with a link to your *unique* mixed project
   - some possible next steps that might be interesting directions you or someone could take this project in, if you had time and interest
1. publish that post with category "Scratch"
